					<h1>Transaction Integrity in Microservices</h1>

					<h2>ACID Principles</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment fade-in">Atomicity: All or none; rollback if any transaction fails</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in">Consistency: Data should always be consistent</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in">Isolation: Transactions should run isolated</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in">Durability: Data should reside safely after commit</li>
					</ul>

								<h2>CAP Theorem</h2>
								<p>It is a concept that a distributed database system can only have 2 of the following</p> 
								<ul>
									<li>Consistency</li>
									<li>Availability</li>
									<li>Partition Tolerant</li>
								</ul>
						</section>
						<section>
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Consistency: A guarantee that every node in a distributed cluster returns the same, most recent, successful write</li>
								<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Availability: Every non-failing node returns a response for all read and write requests in a reasonable amount of time</li>
								<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Partition Tolerant: The system continues to function and upholds its consistency guarantees in spite of network partitions (network split due to the failure of network devices)</li>
							</ul>
						</section>
						<section>
							<p>In any networked shared-data systems partition tolerance is a must. Network partitions and dropped messages are a fact of life and must be handled appropriately.</p>
								
							<p class="fragment fade-in">The correct way to think about CAP is that in case of a network partition (a rare occurrence) one needs to choose between availability and consistency.</p>

					<h2>Transaction Management in Monoliths</h2>
					<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Many platforms provide transaction APIs (e.g. Asp.Net Core TransactionScope) which manage involved transactions with begin, commit, rollback methods. </p>
					<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Database transaction management capabilities can also be used to execute multiple commands on the same database.</p>

					<section>
							<h2>Methods</h2>
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Avoiding transactions across Microservices </li>
								<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Two Phase Commit (2PC)</li>
								<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Saga Pattern</li>
							</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Avoiding transactions across Microservices</h2>
						<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">During design time, eliminate transactional dependencies to other services as much as possible.</p>
						<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">For example in an Order scenario, user’s last order time can be retrieved from Order micro service with an extra call instead adding another field to the User entity and update the value after user submits an order. </p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Two-Phase Commit (2PC)</h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Defined in 1991</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">2 phases; voting, commit</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Voting phase, is where all the concerned resources are asked to “prepare”</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Commit phase, confirms the new state of all the concerned resources</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">In the event of an error, the protocol rolls back and all the resources reach the previous state.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Two-Phase Commit (2PC)</h2>
						<p>The following standards can be used:</p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">XA Standard: All JTA-compliant application servers support this standard</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">REST-AT Standard (draft): still under development by RedHat, application server acts as a transaction coordinator with a specific REST API</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Two-Phase Commit (2PC)</h2>

						<h3>Advantages</h3>
						<p>Easy to understand, centrally managed</p>
						<p>Immediate response to end user</p>
						
						<h3>Drawbacks</h3>
						<p>2pc is synchronous (blocking)</p>
						<p>Locks the object that will be changed before the transaction completes</p>

						<h2>Saga Pattern</h2>
					</section>
					
					<section>
							<p>First introduced in 1987 in an <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/cs711/2002fa/reading/sagas.pdf">academic paper</a></p>
							<img class="stretch" src="images/saga-paper.png" />
					</section>

					<section>
							<p>A saga is a sequence of local transactions.</p> 
							<p class="fragment fade-in">Each local transaction updates the database and publishes a message or event to trigger the next local transaction in the saga. </p> 
							<p class="fragment fade-in">If a local transaction fails because it violates a business rule then the saga executes a series of compensating transactions that undo the changes that were made by the preceding local transactions.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
							<h3>Methods</h3>
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment fade-in">Events/Choreography</li>
								<li class="fragment fade-in">Command/Orchestration</li>
							</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
							<h3>Events/Choreography</h3>
							<p>Each local transaction publishes domain events that trigger local transactions in other services</p>
							<img class="stretch" style="background: white;" src="images/saga-choreography.png" />
					</section>

					<section>
							<h3>Command/Orchestration</h3>
							<p>An orchestrator (object) tells the participants what local transactions to execute</p>
							<img class="stretch" style="background: white;" src="images/saga-orchestration.png" />
					</section>

					<section>
							<p>Events can be emitted over Message Queues or Databases</p>
							<p>Routing capabilities of the Message Queues can be used to put the messages to the inbox queues of the related services</p>
					</section>


					<section>
							<h3>Drawbacks</h3>
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment fade-in">Difficult to debug</li>
								<li class="fragment fade-in">Event messages could become difficult to maintain</li>
								<li class="fragment fade-in">Does not have read isolation</li>
								<li class="fragment fade-in">Additional work to atomically update the database and emit an event</li>
							</ul>
					</section>

				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Eventual Consistency</h2>
					<p class="fragment fade-in">Mechanisms of ensuring that the system would be eventually consistent at some point in the future</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-in">By carefully considering all possible failure scenarios, we can ensure that our system would satisfy the conditions of eventual consistency</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-in">For example if one of the messages got lost, or some other failure happened, the Order microservice finds all non-completed orders by scheduled batch-processing and processes them</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Maintaining Atomicity while Updating State and Publishing Event</h2>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>2PC is not an option because DB and MQ are different systems</p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment fade-in">Application Events (ebay) -> application inserts an event into an event table and another process polls that event table and publishes them</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-in">Database triggers the event</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-in">Transaction log tailing (linkedin) -> tails database commit logs and publishes events based on that</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-in">Event sourcing</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
